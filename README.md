### PIC16 Class B Library

---

### Introduction
Microchip has developed a library of low-level software routines and hardware peripherals that simplify meeting IEC 60730 requirements for Class B Safety. Each product family (PIC16, PIC18, PIC24, dsPIC DSC and PIC32) has functions specifically designed work efficiently with the available resources. Application Note [AN1799](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/00001799A.pdf) describes the Application Programming Interface (API) functions that are available in the Class B Safety Software Library and how to incorporate them in your project.

#### Notes About this version
This version of the Class B library complies with Table H1 of IEC60730{ed5.0}b.

#### Microchip Required Tools
The libraries were tested using [Microchip MPLAB<sup>&reg;</sup> XC8 Compiler](http://www.microchip.com/xc8) versions 1.31 to 1.36

#### Getting Started
See [Class B Library Help.pdf](./documents/Class B Library Help.pdf) to get started using the libraries.

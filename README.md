### PIC16 Class B Library
#### NOTE: NOT RECOMMENDED FOR NEW DESIGNS

---

### Introduction
Microchip has developed a library of low-level software routines and hardware peripherals that simplify meeting IEC 60730 requirements for Class B Safety. Each product family (PIC16, PIC18, PIC24, dsPIC DSC and PIC32) has functions specifically designed work efficiently with the available resources. Application Note [AN1229](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/01229C.pdf) describes the Application Programming Interface (API) functions that are available in the Class B Safety Software Library and how to incorporate them in your project.

#### Notes About this version
This version of the Class B library complies with Table H.11.12.7 of IEC60730{ed3.2}.

#### Microchip Required Tools
The libraries were tested using [Microchip HI-TECH Pro Compiler](ftp://Compilers-RO:C0mP!0511@ftp.microchip.com/) versions 9.81 and [MPLAB<sup>&reg;</sup> 8 IDE](http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en-us/family/mplabx/) (See Downloads Archive toward bottom of page)
